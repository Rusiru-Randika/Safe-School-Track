# Safe School Track System 😸

A comprehensive system ensuring the safety of schoolchildren during transit between home and school. The **Safe School Track System** utilizes Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to provide real-time tracking, secure communication, and efficient data management among parents, drivers, and educators.

## Features 🌟
- **Real-Time Tracking**: Alerts for pickup, drop-off, and absence events.
- **Absence Management**: Parents can notify drivers of absences, improving route optimization.
- **Emergency Reporting**: Direct communication in emergencies.
- **Account Management**: Create, update, and manage parent and driver accounts effortlessly.
- **Secure Database**: Robust relational database with SQL injection protection.
- **Notification System**: Sends account creation alerts with plans for expanded functionality.

## Technical Highlights 💻
- Implements key OOP principles:
  - **Inheritance**: Reuse common logic across classes like `User`, `ParentManager`, and `Driver`.
  - **Polymorphism**: Overridden methods for dynamic behaviors.
  - **Abstraction**: Abstract base class (`User`) enforces subclass-specific methods.
  - **Encapsulation**: Secure access to private fields via getters and setters.
- Modular components:
  - `User`, `ParentManager`, `Driver`, `StudentManager`, `LoginManager`, `DatabaseManager`, and `NotificationManager`.
- Scalable and extensible architecture for future enhancements.
